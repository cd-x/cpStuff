This is stash file created to monitor stashing.
STASHING: The concept of stashing is to stash a WIP (work in progress file) and continue
	  working on more priotirized work. after completing that we can always git stash apply
	  to restart working on previous file.

STATUS: It can only be stashed if file was already staged by git and we are updating it.
	file can't be stashed if it is newly created and git has no idea about new file.
